# simon-memeory-game
As part of my web development module I was tasked with making a Simon memory game using js, css and html
the requirements I was given are as follows:

1. Click the START button to begin, the	game status indicator (the red/green light below	the START button)	switches	from RED	to GREEN. The	game	will	begin 3s	after	the	light	turn GREEN.	
2. Simon	will	give	the	first	signal (randomly flash a	coloured	button). Repeat the	signal by	clicking	the	same colour button.	
3. Simon	will	duplicate	 the	first	 signal and add one. Repeat	these two signals by clicking the same	colour buttons, in order.	
4. Simon	will	duplicate	these first two	signals and add	one.	
5. Continue playing	as long as you	can	repeat each sequence of	 signals correctly. After the 5th,9th	and	13th	signals Simon	atomically speeds up the	interval between signals.	
6. If  you fail to repeat a	 sequence exactly, or  if	 you	 take more than 5 seconds to	 repeat a	 signal,	
Simon responds by	flashing all four buttons	simultaneously five	times. This means	you	have lost,	
and	the sequence	of signals	ends. The	game status indicator switches from GREEN	to RED and you will	have to click START	button to	begin a new game.		
7. Your progress (the number	of	correctly	repeated	signals) for the game just completed (last game) is shown in the	display to the	right of the START button. The all-time highest score is shown in the display to the left of the	START button.
